# CUGA Template Sync

Read the current CUGA SDK source and update `cuga-templates/` so future `cuga-migrator` runs produce
accurate implementations. Run this whenever `migration_to/cuga-agent/` is updated to a new SDK
version — before starting a migration.

## Paths

| Variable | Path |
|----------|------|
| CUGA SDK source | `migration_to/cuga-agent/src/cuga/sdk.py` |
| CUGA SDK examples (supervisor) | `migration_to/cuga-agent/docs/examples/travel_agent/` |
| CUGA SDK examples (one_agent) | `migration_to/cuga-agent/docs/examples/cuga_with_runtime_tools/` |
| Supervisor template | `cuga-templates/supervisor/` |
| A2A supervisor template | `cuga-templates/a2a_supervisor_external/` |
| One-agent template | `cuga-templates/one_agent/` |

<Steps>

<Step title="1. Read the SDK source carefully before touching any template">

1. **`migration_to/cuga-agent/src/cuga/sdk.py`** — the authoritative source. Extract every
   accepted parameter (with type + docstring) of `CugaSupervisor.__init__()` and
   `CugaAgent.__init__()`. Find how `supervisor_config.yaml` / `agent_config.yaml` are parsed —
   list every YAML field actually consumed. Determine which component loads policies
   (`cuga_folder`, `auto_load_policies`).
2. **`.../supervisor_utils/supervisor_config.py`** (or wherever `load_supervisor_config` lives) —
   confirm exactly which top-level YAML keys it consumes vs. ignores. This is the source of truth
   for the YAML schema.
3. **`.../src/cuga/settings.toml`** and **`.../src/cuga/config.py`** — every
   `advanced_features.*` flag affecting supervisor/agent behaviour (e.g.
   `force_autonomous_mode`, `decomposition_strategy`, `lite_mode`). These are dynaconf settings,
   not `__init__` parameters, overridable via `DYNACONF_ADVANCED_FEATURES__<NAME>` env vars.
4. **`.../prompts/supervisor_lite_prompt.jinja2`** — the supervisor's actual system prompt. Note
   any Jinja conditionals whose behaviour the templates' guidance comments describe.
5. **`docs/examples/travel_agent/`** and **`docs/examples/cuga_with_runtime_tools/`** — canonical
   examples. Treat as secondary references: they can lag `sdk.py`, cross-check before trusting.

</Step>

<Step title="2. Check every file under cuga-templates/ for drift">

For each `*_config.yaml` (supervisor, a2a_supervisor_external, one_agent): enumerate every
top-level and nested key, cite the exact SDK or entrypoint file:line that consumes it, or mark it
**DEAD** and remove it (dead only if neither the SDK nor the template's own entrypoint reads it —
common dead suspects: `supervisor.strategy`, `supervisor.mode`). Verify YAML ↔ entrypoint
consistency both directions — a key the SDK would consume via `from_yaml` but the template's
manual loader silently drops is a silent-drift bug; fix it. Confirm constraint comments are
accurate (e.g. if `special_instructions` IS consumed, the comment must say so, not "DO NOT add").

For each `*_entrypoint.py`: import paths match current SDK package structure; constructor calls
use only parameters that actually exist; no deprecated/removed parameters referenced; every
config lookup corresponds to a key actually present in that template's YAML.

For each `mcp_servers/mcp_server_template.py` / `a2a_agents/a2a_agent_template.py`: import paths,
decorator/class patterns, and entrypoint calls match current SDK/A2A package versions.

For each `scripts/start.sh`: startup commands (module path, env vars, ports) match the canonical
example.

For each `.cuga/<type>/*.md` policy template: YAML frontmatter uses the field names and
`triggers` structure the SDK actually parses for that `type`.

For `cuga-templates/one_agent/.agents/skills/skill_template/SKILL.md`: frontmatter (`name`,
`description`) matches what `CugaAgent` reads for skills; body section structure (When to Use,
Workflow, Output Format, Error Handling) reflects current best practice.

For `cuga-templates/tests/runner_template.py`: `Agent.create()` call matches the current entrypoint
API; import placeholder pattern still works; parallel-execution/output-path logic matches what
the evaluator stage expects.

For `cuga-templates/README.md`: file listing and descriptions still match what's actually on disk.

</Step>

<Step title="3. Update — minimal, targeted edits">

Edit only the parts that are wrong or outdated; do not rewrite entire files. When fixing a
comment, replace it with the accurate one in the same style. If the SDK added a new field, add a
commented-out example line with a `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` note. If a field was removed, remove it (with
a brief inline comment explaining the removal if it prevents confusion).

</Step>

<Step title="4. Write the sync report">

First capture the SDK commit so future syncs can tell whether they're operating against the same
state:

```bash
cd migration_to/cuga-agent && git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "not-a-git-repo"
```

Write `migration_to/.cuga-migrator/sync_report.md`:

```markdown
# CUGA Sync Report

**Date**: <today>
**SDK path**: migration_to/cuga-agent/
**SDK commit**: <git SHA or "not-a-git-repo">

## Changes made
- <file>: <what was wrong> -> <what was fixed>

## No changes needed
- <file>: confirmed accurate

## Dead YAML keys removed
- `<template>/<config>.yaml`: removed `<key>` (confirmed dead against `<sdk-file>:<line>` and `<entrypoint-file>:<line>`)

## Silent YAML <-> entrypoint drift fixed
- `<template>/<entrypoint>.py`: now reads `<key>` from YAML and forwards it to `<SDK call>` (was silently ignored before)

## Key SDK facts (for cuga-migrator awareness)
- CugaSupervisor: accepts <parameters>; does NOT support <what it lacks>
- CugaAgent: accepts <key parameters>
- Policy loading: owned by <supervisor|agent|both>
- YAML fields consumed by supervisor config: <list, citing SDK file:line>
- YAML fields consumed by agent config: <list, citing SDK file:line>

## Behaviour-shaping settings (not in __init__)
- `<setting.path>` (default `<value>`): <one-line effect>
```

This report is read by the migration orchestrator and passed to the analyst as context. Keep it
factual and terse — list every template file checked, both changed and unchanged, so coverage is
visible.
