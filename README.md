# cuga-harness-kit

Skills that teach Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Bob how to install, launch, and build with [cuga](https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent) — the open-source generalist agent framework.

## Assistant quickstart

Paste this into Claude Code or Cursor or Bob from the project folder you want to set up:

```text
Run `uv tool install cuga-harness-kit`, then `cuga-harness-kit init` in this folder. Then suggest what I should do next to get cuga running.
```

The assistant will install this kit, scaffold the cuga guidance files, then suggest the next steps:

1. `uv add cuga` — add cuga to your project.
2. Create a `.env` — use `docs/cuga-env-api-keys.md` for your LLM provider.
3. `uv run cuga start demo` — launch the demo UI.
4. Ask *"help me build a cuga tool"* or *"how do I add a policy"* when you're ready to build.

## Manual install

No git clone, no marketplace install:

```bash
uv tool install cuga-harness-kit
cuga-harness-kit init
```

If you're installing inside an already-active virtualenv instead of as a CLI tool, use `uv pip install cuga-harness-kit`.

Run `init` from an empty new project you're starting from scratch, or from inside an existing cuga checkout — either way it writes the same skill set into the current directory:

- `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — auto-discovered by Claude Code.
- `.cursor/rules/cuga-<name>.mdc` — auto-discovered by Cursor.
- `AGENTS.md` — read by Codex. Re-running `init` only touches the managed block, so it won't clobber the rest of the file.
- `.bob/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — auto-discovered by IBM Bob.
- `docs/cuga-env-api-keys.md` — local reference for `.env` API-key setup.

## What's included

| Skill | Teaches |
|---|---|
| `getting-started` | Entry point — routes to the right skill below. |
| `install-and-launch` | `uv init`, `uv add cuga`, `.env` API keys, `uv run cuga start <mode>`. |
| `build-agent` | `CugaAgent` / `CugaSupervisor` SDK basics. |
| `build-cuga-skill` | Authoring cuga's own **runtime** skills — not the same as the IDE-assistant skills in this repo. |
| `build-tool` | Registering a LangChain / OpenAPI / MCP tool. |
| `author-policy` | Intent guards, playbooks, tool approval/guides, output formatters. |
| `knowledge-rag` | Document ingestion/search. |
| `debug-trajectory` | `cuga viz`, `cuga doctor`, common failure patterns. |

Each is authored once as a `SKILL.md` under `src/cuga_harness_kit/plain-skills/`, then rendered into the Cursor/Codex shapes (or used verbatim for Claude/Bob) at `init` time.

## CLI

```bash
cuga-harness-kit init [--targets claude,cursor,codex,bob] [--force] [--dry-run]
cuga-harness-kit update   # alias for `init --force`
```

- `--targets` — comma-separated subset of `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, `bob` (default: all four).
- `--force` — overwrite scaffolded files that already exist and differ (default: skip and report).
- `--dry-run` — print what would be written without touching disk.

## Migration pipeline (optional, claude/bob only)

Besides the guidance skills above, this kit can also scaffold **cuga-migrator** — a separate tool
that converts an *existing* agent system into a cuga SDK implementation, via a 5-stage pipeline
(analyst → implementer → test_writer → evaluator → debugger). It's opt-in and exclusive: it
replaces the guidance skills for that run rather than adding to them.

```bash
cuga-harness-kit init --targets claude --migration   # or --targets bob
```

This scaffolds the migration skills/agents, launch scripts, `cuga-templates/`, and
`migration_from/`/`migration_to/`, then clones the [cuga SDK](https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent)
for the pipeline to reference. Once scaffolded, three more subcommands become available:

```bash
cuga-harness-kit migrate <source-name> <target-name>
cuga-harness-kit source_sync <source-name>
cuga-harness-kit cuga_sync
```

You can also just ask Claude Code / Bob directly, in natural language. See the scaffolded kit's
own `README.md` for the full walkthrough. Useful flags: `--skip-sdk` (don't clone the SDK),
`--cuga-ref <branch-or-tag>` (pin a version).

## Updating

New releases of `cuga-harness-kit` ship improved skill content. To pick it up in a project that already ran `init`:

```bash
uv tool upgrade cuga-harness-kit
cuga-harness-kit update
```

`update` overwrites scaffolded files unconditionally — if you hand-edited one to customize it, `update` will clobber that edit (there's no diff/merge, except for `AGENTS.md`'s managed block). Copy customizations out first if you want to keep them.

## cuga project setup

When the generated skills help you install cuga in an app, they default to a `uv` project so dependencies are captured in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
uv init my-cuga-app
cd my-cuga-app
uv add cuga
```

For API keys and provider settings, see [`docs/env-api-keys.md`](docs/env-api-keys.md).

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```
